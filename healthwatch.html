              It is important to monitor our heart rate once a while. But for
              some of us it is good to keep monitor regularly. Specially
              <b>senior citizen.</b> Therefore we came up with the idea to build
              a <strong>wearable watch</strong>.

            <h3>Ronesh Sinha, M.D.(copied from an article SutterHealth)</h3>
            <blockquote>
              “I’ve noticed that my resting heart rate will be around 55 beats
              per minute when I first get up in the quiet early morning, but it
              will jump up into the 80s when I’m trying to get the kids to
              school on time. It’s a direct reminder for me throughout the day
              to slow down and breathe.”
            </blockquote>

              This above statement shows us how important to monitor the heart
              rate frequently.

            <h3>Our experience through out the project</h3>
            <p>
              First of all this was a novel experience to us since this was not
              just a part of some system but full hardware software system.
              Software that view the received data, sensors which read the data,
              MC that controlls all the events, seperate wifi module which sends
              the data to the cloud and an Azure server which keeps our backend
              on. Alltogether this is the most amazing project that we have
              build so far. Why I mentioned this is amazing is because at the
              end of all the hardwork we have learn a lot more in this project.
              This was the first time we did flutter application. This was the
              first time we deployed an application to a cloud server. Therefore
              this journey was not that easy. With all the errors that we faced
              time to time we could learn a lot through finding solutions to
              these errors.

              >From designing the model for the casing and finshing with proper
              documentation was a complete procedure to put a product to the
              market. That was the main reason this project was such a brilliant
              opportunity to us to gain more knowledge and become so much than
              just developing a software or hardware circuit.<br /><br />
              Overall it was a great experience.<br />
